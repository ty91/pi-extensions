# Interface Design

When the user wants to explore alternative interfaces for a chosen deepening candidate, design it more than once. Based on "Design It Twice" (Ousterhout) — your first idea is unlikely to be the best.

Uses the vocabulary in [LANGUAGE.md](LANGUAGE.md) — **module**, **interface**, **seam**, **adapter**, **leverage**.

## Process

### 1. Frame the problem space

Write a user-facing explanation of the problem space for the chosen candidate:

- The constraints any new interface would need to satisfy
- The dependencies it would rely on, and which category they fall into (see [DEEPENING.md](DEEPENING.md))
- A rough illustrative code sketch to ground the constraints — not a proposal, just a way to make the constraints concrete

### 2. Design alternatives

Produce 2–3 meaningfully different interfaces for the deepened module. Each design should optimize for a different constraint:

- **Minimal interface** — aim for 1–3 entry points max. Maximise leverage per entry point.
- **Flexible interface** — support more use cases and extension where the current code genuinely needs it.
- **Common-case interface** — optimise for the most common caller and make the default case trivial.
- **Ports & adapters interface** — use only when cross-seam dependencies justify multiple adapters.

For each design, include:

1. Interface (types, methods, params — plus invariants, ordering, error modes)
2. Usage example showing how callers use it
3. What the implementation hides behind the seam
4. Dependency strategy and adapters (see [DEEPENING.md](DEEPENING.md))
5. Trade-offs — where leverage is high, where it's thin

### 3. Present and compare

Present designs sequentially so the user can absorb each one, then compare them in prose. Contrast by **depth** (leverage at the interface), **locality** (where change concentrates), and **seam placement**.

After comparing, give your own recommendation: which design you think is strongest and why. If elements from different designs would combine well, propose a hybrid. Be opinionated — the user wants a strong read, not a menu.
