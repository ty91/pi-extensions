# Codex Apply Patch

A Pi coding-agent extension that adds an `apply_patch` tool and a Codex-style patch harness so GPT-5-family models can propose structured diffs which Pi applies.

This follows the OpenAI Apply Patch / V4A diff flow:
- The model calls `apply_patch` with a raw Codex patch envelope in `patch`
- Each file section is one of `*** Add File:`, `*** Update File:`, `*** Delete File:`
- Update sections use V4A-style context/add/delete lines

## What you get

- A Pi tool named **`apply_patch`**
- Codex-style patch parsing (`*** Begin Patch` / `*** End Patch`)
- Atomic writes
- Streaming progress updates in the Pi TUI

## Install

### Option A: Install as a Pi package

```bash
pi install git:github.com/ty91/pi-extensions
```

Then start Pi normally.

### Option B: Copy into Pi extensions directory

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/extensions
cp ./extensions/codex-apply-patch/index.ts ~/.pi/agent/extensions/codex-apply-patch.ts
```

### Option C: Load the extension explicitly

```bash
pi -e /absolute/path/to/pi-extensions/extensions/codex-apply-patch/index.ts
```

## Usage

When the active model ID starts with `gpt-5`, the extension:
- enables the `apply_patch` tool
- disables Pi's built-in `edit`/`write` tools (so the model must use structured patches)

## Tool schema

`apply_patch` expects:

```json
{
  "patch": "*** Begin Patch\n*** Update File: src/app.ts\n@@\n-old\n+new\n*** End Patch\n"
}
```

Notes:
- Pi custom tools still require a JSON wrapper, but the `patch` value is the raw Codex patch body.
- `*** Add File:` content lines must start with `+`.
- `*** Update File:` sections use `@@` hunks with `+`/`-`/` ` lines and optional `*** Move to:`.
- `*** Delete File:` has no body.
- Absolute paths and `../` paths are allowed, matching Codex-style path resolution more closely.
- `*** Add File:` and `*** Move to:` may overwrite existing files.
- Operations stop at the first failure; earlier successful changes are not rolled back.

## Benchmarks & quality notes (informal)

These are notes from local A/B runs to understand how “forced apply_patch” behaves vs Pi’s normal `edit`/`write` flow.

- **baseline** = Pi built-in `edit`/`write`
- **apply_patch** = this extension (forces structured diffs)
- Each number below is the **mean of 10 runs** on the same repo snapshot and prompt.
- **Cost** is taken from Pi’s JSONL `usage.cost.total`.

### Small change (single-file fix)

In a tiny one-file fix, forcing apply_patch was usually slower and more expensive.

- `gpt-5.2`: baseline **$0.0467 / 44.6s** vs apply_patch **$0.0587 / 50.1s**
- `gpt-5.2-codex`: baseline **$0.0291 / 22.6s** vs apply_patch **$0.0405 / 33.1s**

### Multi-file change (feature across a few files)

In a multi-file fix (3–5 files), results depended on the model:

- `gpt-5.2`: baseline **$0.1557 / 136.4s** vs apply_patch **$0.1470 / 129.7s**
- `gpt-5.2-codex`: baseline **$0.1002 / 82.6s** vs apply_patch **$0.1180 / 95.0s**

Tool reliability note (10-run totals): on `gpt-5.2-codex`, forcing apply_patch reduced tool errors (**34 → 17**), but it cost more and took longer.

### Code-quality observations from diffs

- apply_patch gives a nice **audit trail** (explicit file ops + diffs). That’s the main “quality” win.
- It doesn’t automatically guarantee cleaner code. In a few runs, models used shortcuts to get tests green (e.g. adding a hidden field like `__timesLeft` or escaping types with `any`).
- Some runs also touched unrelated files (import specifier changes, etc.). That’s not always wrong, but it adds churn.

Practical takeaway: if your priority is reviewability/reproducibility, forcing apply_patch is a good default. If you optimize for tiny one-line fixes, baseline tooling is often cheaper.

## Development

This is a single-file extension. You typically don't need to build anything; Pi loads the TypeScript directly.
